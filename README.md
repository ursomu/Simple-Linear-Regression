# Simple-Linear-Regression
Description: This repository contains a basic implementation of Simple Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm. The project  model training, and evaluation with visualizations to illustrate the linear relationship between variables. Suitable for beginners in machine learning.

What is Linear Regression : 
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (often called the target or response) and one or more independent variables (called features or predictors). The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line (in the case of simple linear regression) or a hyperplane (in the case of multiple linear regression) that minimizes the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

Key Points:
Simple Linear Regression: Involves one independent variable. The relationship is modeled as:

𝑦
=
𝑏
0
+
𝑏
1
𝑥
y=b 
0
​
 +b 
1
​
 x
where:

𝑦
y is the dependent variable,
𝑥
x is the independent variable,
𝑏
0
b 
0
​
  is the intercept (the value of 
𝑦
y when 
𝑥
=
0
x=0),
𝑏
1
b 
1
​
  is the slope (the change in 
𝑦
y for a one-unit change in 
𝑥
x).
Multiple Linear Regression: Involves two or more independent variables. The relationship is modeled as:

𝑦
=
𝑏
0
